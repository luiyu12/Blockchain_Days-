 Revision time : 
 
 * concept of money : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzoX7zEZ6h4
 
 * where did btc come from ?? must check : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W15A7Lf0_fI
 
* Bitcoin network history : why btc ?...architecture, working...{check its whitepaper too : https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf }

* why ethereum ? main features explore....turing completeness, smart contracts contacts,

* Blockchain network ?? mempools ?? blockchain validation working ?? consensus algorithms : SHA256 and others ?? 
    miners ?? how blocks are interconnected ? attributes in blocks ??      

* Transaction fee in ethereum : eth,gwei, ...why need to pay fee ??? : 
    smart contracts have operations(including operands and many functions)
    and each operand/function have a specific fee, for more :google
    
* explore more about Blockchain, must watch code eater 6 hour vdo,,,here is the link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aF6p2VUORE

* concept of DAO, explore the Dao attack , why ( eth and eth cash) or (btc and btc cash) ?...read about hard and soft fork.... 

* READ ABOUT ORACLE PROBLEM AND SOLUTION : 
 while confirming the transaction, blocks needs data...if they are getting it from outer world, then..in this case;
 we are losing the main property of centralization (meaning that the data coming from outside world can be manipulated),
 so this is oracle problem and to solve the CHAINLINK is helping. 
 ==>> Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely access off-chain data feeds, 
 web APIs, and traditional bank payments. Chainlink is critical to connecting the blockchain ecosystem to the rest of the world. <==
 simply: Chainlink provides data and external computation to smart contracts in decentralized manner. 
 you must check check here  : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJfkNzyO7-U 
 must must check here too : https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles 
 
 * know more about ethereum features, its usecases .....
 
 * explore the NEAR PROTOCOL ?? 
 
 * ethereum main problems ?? 
 
 * read more about layer-2 scaling solution and how the indian project : POLYGON is solving it ? what are they doing ?? 
 
 * Know more about Solana ecosystem ?? solana vs ethereum ??? the trend of nfts in solana network  ?? 
       google : ddos attack in solana ( from where hackers took millions of $ ) 
 
 * LUNA ?? luna vs ethereum ??
 
 (((((((( Bitcoin halving ?? btc 4 year cycle ?? )))))))))))))))))))))))))) 
 * EXPLORE : DAPPS , DEFI , NFTS , METAVERSE 
 * what is axie infinity (AXS)?? what is MANA, SAND (and their use in metaverse) ?? 
 you can check the chart of axs in tradingview and explore more about it, why price moved to >1oo from only 5,6$ ?? 
 concept of earn and play in AXS and then ,,,the trend of nfts came, then eth boom boom (all transactions need to be done in mostly eth, 
 and as nfts are minted over ethereum network) that caused eth to go over 4,000/-
 ....and following the path of axs,then TLM too came into hype..... 
 
 * what is POW  and POS 
 * what is ethereum 2.0 ?? how it is solving problems of ethereum ?? can it compete with solana ecosystem ?? 
 * POS working in ethereum 2.0 
 * explore a block : https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/f560f3cb1dda594f7fe5f665c4c2d45684764949bb5a5567d53f6a72744fbc1a
                     https://etherscan.io/tx/0x03308e0e7a0b18098e286f6f89b3c88415761e721d15dac408e7ecc764bc6eb0
     about HASH, data, timesamp, gas fees, and more.......
     
 * explore more about these terms : nodes, blocks, nonce, miners , validaters
 Ethereum actually runs on Keccak256.
==> Hash is a unique fixed length string to identify a piece of data.
==> Hash algorithm is a function that computes data into a unique hash.
==>  Mining is the process of finding a "solution" to the blockchain "problem".
==>  Nodes get paid for mining blocks.
==>  Block is a list of transactions mined together.
==>  Nonce is a "number used once" to find the "solution" to the blockchain problem.
==>  Nonce is also used to define the transaction number for an account/address.
